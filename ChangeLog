	* "Associated-value" mod
	- insert(str, val) inserts an associated value *val*, not the *str* itself, into the DB.
	- Similarly, retrieve(query) returns values associated to the strings, not the strings themselves.
	- Frontend reads two lines (a string first, then the associated integer value, and it returns associated integers for strings found by a query.
	- Associated values are 64-bit integer.
